### Hi👋 My name is Hoseok Lee, an aspring software developer😄
I worked at Continental Automotive Electronics, a global automotive part company, as a senior embedded software developer from Oct 2014 to Jul 2019.
Now, I am preparing graduate school admission and aim to pursue academic careers through PhD course.

My personal study plan is shown as below table. In this study plan, my motto is that "Back to the basic"🌱.
After completing the plan studying theories, I will start doing personal projects, such as kernel porting, device driver control, scheduling, camera control, ethernet, with an ODROID embedded board based on LINUX operating system.  
I will update my personal plan and my personal project periodically.
