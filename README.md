### HiðŸ‘‹ My name is Hoseok Lee, an aspring software developerðŸ˜„
I worked at Continental Automotive Electronics, a global automotive part company, as a senior embedded software developer from Oct 2014 to Jul 2019.
Now, I'm pursuing my research interest at the University of Virginia, Computer Science department as a PhD student.

My personal study plan is shown as below table. In this study plan, my motto is that "Back to the basic"ðŸŒ±.
After completing the plan studying theories, I will start doing personal projects with an ODROID embedded board based on LINUX operating system.  
I will update my personal plan and my personal project periodically.
